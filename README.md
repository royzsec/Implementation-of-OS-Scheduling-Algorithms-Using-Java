# Implementation-of-OS-Scheduling-Algorithms-Using-Java
This project involves developing a Java-based application to simulate and analyze CPU scheduling algorithms, including **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)**, **Shortest Job First (SJF)**, and **Round Robin (RR)**. The application connects to a MySQL database to store process data and scheduling results, providing insights into average waiting and turnaround times. A user-friendly graphical interface allows users to execute the algorithms and view real-time comparison charts. The project highlights the strengths and limitations of each algorithm, with **SJF** excelling in minimizing waiting time, **RR** ensuring fairness, and **FCFS** being simple but less efficient.
